# Acorn_Plus_1_Reimagine
Recreation of the Acorn Plus 1 based off of original schematic and redrawn schematic

First version created June 2023.
Using original schematic from Acorn and redrawn schematic by P.Harvey

Points to note, redrawn schematic has -5V going to Analogue port should be +5V
Pin 2 of IC6 needs connecting to Pin 3 of IC8.

Other issues to correct:-

IC6 needs moving 1.2mm up so AP6 board will fit

Two holes missing one mounting hole and one hole by lower edge connector

Resistor size chosen a bit small just fits

Left analogue hole needs to be moved 2mm as doesnt align with lower case

IC8 Ground connection on back needs increasing 1mm

Recheck layout and tidy up visual issues.
